	  analyzing tool in Linux, available from kernel version
	  2.6.31. User-space controlling utility, called 'perf' has
	  git-like interface with subcommands. It is capable of
	  statistical profiling of entire system (both kernel and user
	  code), single CPU or severals threads.

config BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_TOOL_USBIP
	bool "usbipd"
	help
	  The USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing
	  system over IP network. To share USB devices between computers
	  with their full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB I/O
	  messages" into TCP/IP payloads and transmits them between
	  computers. Original USB device drivers and applications can be also
	  used for remote USB devices without any modification of them.

	  This will build and install the userspace 'usbipd'
	  command. It is up to the user to ensure that the kernel
	  configuration has all the suitable options enabled to allow a
	  proper operation of 'usbipd'.
